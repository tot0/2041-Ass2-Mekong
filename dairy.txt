    Not sure how many of these files were actually in the git repo or not, but mekong.py.cgi was, ohwell my messages are relatively informative on what i was working on. Pretty much ready to submit, fixed up a bunch of stuff like adding to cart while not logged in, and cookies not working on ice weasel. Moved all my html stuff liek css and js into assets folder, bit cleaner. I guess its time to tar this all and then test it in a fresh environment.

    Pretty much finished now, still havnt fully tested password reseting but everything frm 0-3 covered, plus im using a db, p;agination, more by this author on book pages, and my site looks VERY nice compared to what the norm will probably be. Should be enough level 4 features in there for a very good mark. i should clean up some of my python though, it can gfet  abit ugly.

    After loads of debugging i got stuck on one issue, my cookie for user id tracking kept getting set to None, couldnt figure it out until i noticed it might noe be editing the global vaariable. So i added global to it and it worked. thats what I get for just writing so much perl code with all variables assumed global, python doesnt do that..
